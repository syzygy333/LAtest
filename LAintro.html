		<h1>Why LA should want BH</h1>	
			<p>Hello. My name is Brian Hogue and I am an excellent candidate for LaunchAcademy's fall cohort because I am highly motivated, I am intrigued by code, I am a dedicated worker and I have a natural inclination toward doing things efficiently and neatly.</p>
			<p>I am highly motivated because, at 34, I am likely older than many people also trying to get into web development. I am dissatisfied with my current career track and want to make a change that will challenge me and provide greater satisfaction.</p>
			<p>I am intrigued by code because up until a few months ago, it was almost completely a mystery to me how any of it worked and how any of it controls a website. As available as information is, learning about code and how to write it feels a little bit like being let into a secret club, or at least making sense of what others still consider a kind of magic.</p>
			<p>And I have always been dedicated to doing any particular job I do to the best of my ability. While learning how code works does <b>not</b> come naturally to me, I <i>am</i> determined to figure it out. When I began, it felt rather illogical and arbitrary, but it is already making more and more sense to me.</p>
			<p>Lastly, I think my tendency toward efficiency and order will serve me well as a web developer. As you know, ugly code CAN work, but code greatly benefits from being written cleanly and with as few stops as possible on the way from Point A to Point B. I think my background as a copy editor will help in this regard. And I believe that once I am more versed in the syntax and the rules of a given language, I can write it in such a way that it makes good sense both to the application and to the coder's eye.</p>
